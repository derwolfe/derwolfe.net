Bash?
-----
Bash (bourne again shell) is the shell I started with. It has been around for a fair amount of time and has been installed on every *nix installation I've used for the past 10 years.
As it was the first shell that I ever used, I took great pains to customize it.
I was happy with the ability to set aliases, write simple functions, manipulate my path.
But, one thing that always left me annoyed, was that I never wanted to write any thing more than a trivial function.
Even the simple things always looked odd in bash.

I then turned to using zsh. I experienced the same issues that I had with bash. the main difference being, zsh started out being more useful from the start than bash did. (Useful being: omnicomplete/suggestions were useful).

After installing ohmyzsh and using it for a significant amount of time, I got sick of maintaining my enormous zshrc files.
To be fair, I have only lazily learned how to use these shells.
My exposure has mostly centered around being able to get something done.

Enter Fish.

Friendly interactive shell (Fish)
