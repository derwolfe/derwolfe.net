I have been using the Fish shell for the past six months and have been loving every minute of it.
I wanted to tell you about it because it is vastly simpler to use than I ever felt both bash and zsh ever were.
But, be advised, while I'm comparing these shells I only have had a *working* knowledge of how to be productive using bash and zsh.

Why do I use my shell?
----------------------
I use my shell mostly for day to day programming work.
Lots of boring directory changes, grepping output, piping commands together, etc.
I also write a fair amount of python and need to switch between virtualenvs frequently.


What do I want?
