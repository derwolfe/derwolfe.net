I have been using the Fish shell for the past six months and have been loving every minute of it.
I wanted to tell you about it because it is vastly simpler to use than I ever felt both bash and zsh ever were.
But, be advised, while I'm comparing these shells I only have had a *working* knowledge of how to be productive using bash and zsh.

What is the point of a shell?
===============================
It is a question that isn't asked because the answer seems really obvious.
At a high level, shells exist so that the users of a system users can access the services that a given system provides.
At a lower level, shells also provide a user the ability to automate the behaviour of the system.
With that in mind, we can start to evaluate shells based on how easily and ergonomically(?) they expose the underlying system to the user.




Fish is so friendly
