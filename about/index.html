  <h1 class="post-title">About</h1>
    <hr />
  <p>Iâ€™m a programmer working out of Lawrence, KS, USA.</p><p>I enjoy writing, reading, and learning about programming, concurrency, computer networking, program safety, and functional programming.</p>
  <p>I've contributed to the amazing <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted project</a>, a networking engine written in Python.
  <p>I am also in the process of writing a file sharing program, <a href="http://github.com/derwolfe/teiler/">Teiler</a> that uses Twisted</p>
